# Data Science Project

This repository documents my progress in the following areas:

- **Data Science**
- **Python for data analysis and machine learning**
- **Azure Machine Learning and cloud services**
- **Creating APIs (FastAPI)**
- **Power BI applied to data projects**

The objective is to build a solid foundation and create complete projects that can be used as a professional portfolio.

## General Objectives for the project

- Create complete Data Science projects, including:
  - data exploration and analysis
  - building and evaluating machine learning models
  - creating reproducible pipelines
  - deploying models in Azure
  - exposing models through APIs
  - developing decision-support dashboards

- Develop practical skills in:
  - **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.)**
  - **Azure ML (Workspaces, Compute, Endpoints, Pipelines)**
  - **FastAPI + Docker + Azure Container Apps**
  - **Power BI connected to cloud data sources**

## What Will Be Developed Here

Over time, this repository will include:

- Notebooks for data exploration, model training and experimentation
- Structured scripts for data preparation and automation
- Reproducible pipelines (local and Azure ML)
- Trained and evaluated machine learning models (not versioned in Git)
- APIs for model serving in production
- Power BI dashboards connected to real data sources
- Detailed technical documentation

## Notes

The contents of the data/raw and data/processed directories are ignored by Git for privacy and size reasons.
Notebooks and scripts may reference these datasets, but the corresponding files must be obtained separately.
